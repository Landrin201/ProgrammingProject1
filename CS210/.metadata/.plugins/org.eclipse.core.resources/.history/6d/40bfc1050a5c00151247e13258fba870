 * 			Date				Author			Reason
 * 		August 14 2015, 	Marc Kuniansky, Refactored main method here.
 * 		August 20 2015, 	Marc Kuniansky, Added two new instance variables, inclFile2 and inclFile 3, as well 
 * 											as two new public methods used to set these values to true. This 
 * 											allows the user to select which optional files they wish to include in 
 * 											application.ini. Modified method execute to work with the UI.
 * 		September 15 2015, 	Marc Kuniansky, Refactored the Execute method to make it a little more manageable. Added the OtherFiles()
 * 											and Finalize methods. The Finalize method was added as a way of forcing the program to
 * 											wait for user input.
