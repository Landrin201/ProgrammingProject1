<p>In this program you will implement a simulation of a mouse looking for a piece 
  of cheese in a maze.</p>
<h3> Problem Specification:</h3>
<p>Design a program to simulate mice moving through a maze until they find cheese.&nbsp; 
  A mouse always starts at the starting position, and moves one unit at a time.&nbsp; 
  Your program should be able to support mice with different movement strategies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One type of mouse teleports directly to the
     cheese (the &quot;beam-me-up mouse&quot;).</li>
  <li>Another moves randomly until it happens to stumble across some 
    cheese (the &quot;clueless mouse&quot;).</li>
  <li>Another moves randomly unless there is cheese in sight within two units,
    in which case it moves to (and eats) the cheese (the &quot;short-sighted
    mouse&quot;).&nbsp; (This mouse does not see cheese that is around a corner,
    even if it is only two units away.)</li>
  <li>Another moves randomly unless there is cheese anywhere in sight, in which
    case it moves toward the cheese (the &quot;long-sighted mouse&quot;).</li>
  <li>Another moves toward the smell of cheese (the &quot;nosy mouse&quot;).&nbsp; 
    <font color="#FF0000">(Implementing this strategy is optional!)</font></li>
  <li>Another moves systematically through the maze until finding the cheese (the 
    &quot;systematic mouse&quot;).&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">(Implementing this 
    strategy is optional!)</font></li>
  <li>You may also implement other strategies that you find interesting.&nbsp; 
    <font color="#FF0000">(Implementing additional strategies is optional!)</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should read in a maze configuration, including the starting position
   and the location of the cheese (the start and end locations for the maze).&nbsp; 
  It should allow the user to run the experiment several times, with different
  maze configuration files.&nbsp; Each
  time, a piece of cheese is put at the end of the maze, a mouse is put at the
  starting
  
  location, and the mouse is allowed to move around the maze looking for the
  cheese.&nbsp; 
  The user should be able to choose the type of mouse or mouse movement strategy
  for each run of the experiment.&nbsp; Your program should graphically display
  the state of the mouse and the maze at the end of each time unit.&nbsp; When
  a mouse finds the cheese, your program should report how many time units it
  took
  for
  the
   mouse to find 
  the cheese.</p>
<h3>More specific details:</h3>
<p>Your program should have a graphical user interface with a File menu, a mouse
  choice drop-down menu, a button to add a mouse, a panel in which the maze is
  graphically displayed, 
  and a slider bar for changing the speed of the mouse movement.&nbsp; (Actually,
   it controls the speed of the animation -- how long the program pauses to let
  
  you view the display between time steps -- rather than the speed of the mice.)</p>
<p>You may use the following classes or files, which have been fully  
  implemented and are available in <a href="MouseInAMaze.zip">MouseInAMaze.zip</a> and
  <a href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/grid.jar">grid.jar</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Cheese</code> - an extension of the <code>ColorBlock</code> 
    class (you could implement it in some other way, though, if you chose)</li>
  <li><code>MazeDataFileHandler</code> - a class that reads 
    the maze information from a file and constructs the maze</li>
  <li><code>MouseFileMenu</code> - a class that provides a
    File menu with an Open menu item; you may ignore this class as it is only
    used by the graphical user interface</li>
  <li><code>MouseMazeController</code> - a class that controls the mouse
    movement during program execution</li>
  <li><code>MouseMazeGUI</code> - a class that provides a graphical
    user interface for the Mouse-in-a-Maze project</li>
  <li><code>maze1.dat</code> - a sample maze initial configuration file</li>
  <li><code>grid.jar</code> 
    - a Java archive library containing classes such as <code>BoundedGrid</code>, 
    <code>ColorBlock</code>, <code>ColorBlockDisplay</code>, <code>BasicGridFileMenu</code>, 
    <i>etc</i>.&nbsp; The class documentation for all classes in this library is
	available <a href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/">online</a>.
	<!-- The <a href="GenericEnvAPI.zip">GridPkg.zip</a> 
    file contains class documentation for <i>all</i> of the classes in this library. --></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to implement or modify the following classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Maze</code> - an extension of the <code>BoundedGrid</code> class</li>
  <li><code>Mouse</code> - an object that moves around the maze looking for cheese</li>
  <li><code>MouseInAMazeApp</code> - a main class that specifies how to display
    mice and color blocks, specifies the type of mice in the program, and 
     constructs a <code>MazeGUI</code> object; you will need to edit this class
     when you add new <code>Mouse</code> types to the project and want them to
     appear in the drop-down menu.</li>
  <li>several classes that represent different types of mice, including the <code>Mouse</code>    class and several subclasses</li>
</ul>
<h3>One possible plan of attack:</h3>
<p>You will probably find it useful to implement this program in stages (<i>iterative 
  development</i>).&nbsp; For example, you might:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Implement the minimum amount of code that will let you compile and run
    a working program. 
	(<a href="#MinimumCode">More details are below.</a>)</li>
  <li>Implement a (theoretically) moving mouse. (<a href="#MovingMouse">More
      details are below.</a>)</li>
  <li>Implement various types of moving mice. (<a href="#ManyMovingMice">More details
      are below.</a>)</li>
  <li>Display the mouse graphically or with an image (this could be done earlier
    if you like). (<a href="#MouseDisplay">More details are below.</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not have to develop the program in this way, but if you want to follow 
  this structured approach you will find more details below.</p>
<h4><a name="MinimumCode"></a>Implementing the minimum amount of code that will
  let you compile and run a working program:</h4>
<ul>
      
  <li>Download <code>mousemaze.zip</code> into the <code>Temp</code> folder on the <code>C</code> drive and extract
    the files.</li>
      
  <li>Create a project in a folder on your <code>M</code> drive and import the
    extracted files from <code>mousemaze.zip</code> into the project (Import from File System).&nbsp; Bring
    up the the File-&gt;Properties dialog box and, in the Java Libraries tab, add
    the <code>grid.jar</code> file
    you&nbsp; just
    imported.</li>
  <li>Construct a <code>Maze</code> class that extends <code>BoundedGrid</code>.&nbsp; The
    <code>MazeDataFileHandler</code> object will read in a maze configuration
    file and construct a <code>Maze</code> object that corresponds to the configuration
    file.&nbsp; In
    order for <code>MazeDataFileHandler</code> to
    work correctly, the new class must be called <code>Maze</code> and it must
    have a two-parameter constructor just like <code>BoundedGrid</code>.&nbsp; It
    should also have two instance variables to keep track of the starting location
    (for the mouse) and the finish location (the location of the cheese).  It
    should have &quot;getter&quot; and &quot;setter&quot; methods for those instance variables, which
    must be called <code>setStartLoc</code>, <code>setFinishLoc</code>, <code>getStartLoc</code>,
    and <code>getFinishLoc</code> in order for the <code>MouseMazeGUI</code> and
    <code>MouseMazeController</code> to work correctly.
   &nbsp; The
        two setter methods must each take a single <code>Location</code> as
        a parameter and have a <code>void</code> return type.&nbsp; The getter
        methods do not need any parameters, but should return the appropriate
    <code>Location</code> object.&nbsp; You should implement the constructor
    and the four methods to interact with your two instance variables correctly.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Construct a <code>Mouse</code> class.&nbsp; The <code>MouseMazeGUI</code> object
        will construct a mouse and add it to the maze when the user clicks on
        an Add Mouse button.&nbsp; In order for <code>MouseMazeGUI</code>        to
        work correctly, the new class must be called <code>Mouse</code> and
         it should have a zero-parameter constructor.&nbsp; As a starting point
         you may wish to have your <code>Mouse</code> class extend the <code>ColorBlock</code> class in
         the same way that <code>Cheese</code> does so that you have something you can easily
         display.&nbsp; You may wish to make your mouse <code>LIGHT_GRAY</code> rather than
         <code>YELLOW</code>.</li>
      <li>Run the program.&nbsp; Use the File menu to open the <code>maze1.dat</code> initial
        configuration file.&nbsp; This should create and display a maze with
    a piece of cheese in it, but no mouse.&nbsp; Test the various components
    of the graphical user interface to see which ones work at this point.&nbsp; Look
    at the contents of maze1.dat and see if you can figure out what each line
    of the file might mean.&nbsp; Test your hypotheses by creating a new initial
    configuration file with different values.</li>
</ul>
    
    
<h4><a name="MovingMouse"></a>Implementing a (theoretically) moving mouse: </h4>
<ul>
      <li>Implement a <code>move</code> method in the <code>Mouse</code> class that does the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Determine the location this mouse should move to.&nbsp; You may
            wish to create a helper method, <code>nextLocation</code> for example,
            that calculates this location.&nbsp; For now, the next location could
            be the current location.</li>
          <li>If the new location is the same as the current location, you're
            done.</li>
          <li>Otherwise,
            <ul>
              <li>If the new location contains the cheese, the mouse should &quot;eat&quot;
                it (remove it from the grid) before attempting to move into that
                location.&nbsp; (You may wish to add a method that
                casts the grid to the <code>Maze</code> class, as described below.)</li>
              <li>Regardless of whether the new location was the one containing
                the cheese, the mouse should move to the new location</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Even though the <code>Mouse</code> class inherits a method from <code>GridObject</code> that
        returns its grid, you may wish to create another method that returns
        the grid as a <code>Maze</code> object so that you don't have to cast
      the grid to a <code>Maze</code> over and over in your program.</li>
      <li>Redefine the <code>toString</code> method in the <code>Mouse</code> class
        to indicate the mouse's class and location.&nbsp; You can get the name
        of an object's class with the following: <code>object.getClass().getName()</code>.</li>
      <li>Test your initial move method.&nbsp; (The mouse should not, in fact,
          move yet.)</li>
</ul>
    
<h4><a name="ManyMovingMice"></a>Implementing various types of moving mice: </h4>
<ul>
      <li>Construct a subclass of the <code>Mouse</code> class that will &quot;teleport&quot;
        directly to the location of the cheese (the &quot;beam me up&quot; mouse).</li>
      <li>Modify your main class to add your new <code>Mouse</code> subclass
        to the list of mouse types passed to the graphical user interface.&nbsp; If
        you do this correctly, your subclass should show up in the drop-down
        menu when you
        run the program.&nbsp; If you have the subclass selected in the drop-down
        menu before you click on the Add Mouse button, the new mouse should be
        a &quot;beam me up&quot; mouse.</li>
      <li>Run your program several times until you have confidence that your
      new <code>Mouse</code> subclass is working correctly.&nbsp; If your program
      throws an exception right away, make sure that your mouse is &quot;eating&quot; the
      cheese before attempting to move into that location, since a grid does
      not allow two objects in the same cell at the same time.</li>
      <li>Modify your program to keep track of how many moves it takes for the
        mouse to find the cheese and report this at the end of the run.&nbsp; You
        may report the toal number of mouse moves with a call to <code>System.out.println</code>,
        or you may investigate using the <code>JOptionPane</code> class (<font color="#FF0000">optional</font>).
        Run your program several times until you have confidence that your calculations
        of the number of moves is working correctly.&nbsp; (You may wish to print
        the total after every step as you are testing, until you are confident
        that it is being calculated correctly.)</li>
      <li>Construct a subclass of the <code>Mouse</code> class that will move
        randomly to any adjacent location in the maze (the &quot;clueless mouse&quot;).&nbsp; You
        may wish to use the <code>nextLocation</code> method from the <code>Fish</code> class
        in the Marine Biology Simulation as a template.</li>
      <li>Add your new <code>Mouse</code> subclass
          to the list of mouse types in your main class.&nbsp; Run your program
          several times until you have confidence that your new <code>Mouse</code> subclass
          is working correctly.</li>
      <li>Construct other subclasses that move  in the various ways described
        in the problem specification above: as a short-sighted
        mouse, a long-sighted mouse, and any
        other types
        you
        choose
        to implement.&nbsp; Add
      each class to the list of mouse types in your main class.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Run each
          type of mouse at least 10 times and manually calculate the average
        number of times each type of mouse takes to find the cheese.</li>
</ul>
    
<h4><a name="MouseDisplay"></a>Displaying a mouse graphically or with an image: </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Update your main class to specify how to display a mouse as something other
    than a color block.&nbsp; You
    could create a <code>MouseDisplay</code> class that draws a mouse graphically,
    or you could
    use 
    an image, such as the <code>mouse.gif</code> image.&nbsp; To associate an
    image with a class, construct a new <code>ScaledImageDisplay</code> as the
    display object, passing it the name of the image file as a <code>String</code> parameter
      (<i>e.g.</i>, 
    &quot;mouse.gif&quot;).
     If you want the image to be take on the appropriate color for a mouse, add
    a <code>ScaledImageTintDecorator</code> to the image display. This will tint
    the image with the color specified by the mouse's <code>color</code> method.&nbsp; You
    can find the class documentation for <code>ScaledImageDisplay</code> and <code>ScaledImageTintDecorator</code> <a href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/">online</a>.<br>
     <br>
     Since your mouse is no longer displayed as a color block, you may wish to
     change your <code>Mouse</code> class to extend <code>GridObject</code> rather
     than <code>ColorBlock</code>.&nbsp; If you do this, and if your method of
     displaying a mouse makes use of its color, you will need to add an instance
     variable and a <code>color</code> method
     to the <code>Mouse</code> class
     to keep track of and report its color.    <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">Optional: </font>If you wish to write a class to display 
    a mouse graphically, you may want to use the <code>FishDisplay</code> class 
    as a model.&nbsp; Note that a display class assumes 
    that it is drawing in a 1 x 1 area with the origin at the center of the area.&nbsp; 
    In other words, the pixels range from -0.5 to 0.5 for both the x and y coordinates.&nbsp; 
    You can leave out (or comment out) the code for the gradient if you prefer.&nbsp;<b> 
    (I suggest you not spend time creating a clever <code>MouseDisplay</code> 
    class until after everything else in your program is working!)</b><br>
  &nbsp; </li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Optional:</font> You can also display the cheese graphically 
    or using an image, if you want.&nbsp; (This is, in fact, the main advantage 
    to having a separate <code>Cheese</code> class, rather than just use an object 
    of the <code>ColorBlock</code> class.)<br>&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Optional:</font> If you want to, you could investigate
    adding an extra two rows at the bottom of a maze and then keeping a running
    total of the number of mouse moves in a cell in the bottom row.</li>
