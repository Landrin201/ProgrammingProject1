<p>
This program draws a grid of a size that the user specifies.
On the left-hand side of the GUI (the user interface that pops up), there
are several buttons with descriptive words on them. Clicking on the buttons
will draw different things. What thing the button draws is described on the 
button. 
<br> <br>
Several functions depend on the size of the grid. Making the width or height
of the grid be less than six will cause the Cake and Candles functions to do 
weird things. The surprise button also won't work that well on a grid that is 
too small. Non-square grids will work fine, but don't do anything too crazy.
