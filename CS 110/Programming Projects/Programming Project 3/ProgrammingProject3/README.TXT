PROJECT TITLE: Histogram Lab and Programming Project 

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project produces a histogram which plots the number of 
times an object lands in a certain location. The location is determined by a 
series of random coin flips. The number of coin flips is determined by the user. 

VERSION or DATE:  

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Within BlueJ, compile the project, if
necessary (see next paragraph).  Then right-click (or control-click)
on the SimpleGridObjectApp class.  Select "void main(String[] args)", then
click on "Ok".

If a Java class needs to be compiled, BlueJ indicates this by
painting stripes across the class's icon.  You can compile a single class
from its editor window by clicking on the Compile button at the top of that
window.  Alternatively, you can compile all classes in the project by
clicking on the Compile button in the toolbar to the left of the central
icon diagram for the project.  (Actually, BlueJ will check which classes
need to be compiled and compile only those.)

AUTHORS: Your Name, based on a template by Alyce Brady and Kelly Schultz

USER INSTRUCTIONS:  This application does everything it needs to do on its own,
so there is nothing for the user to do other than to compile and start the project,
as described above.
