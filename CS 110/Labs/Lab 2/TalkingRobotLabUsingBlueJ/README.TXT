Project Name: Lab 2- A Talking Robot

Purpose and Function: The purpose of this project was to create a talking robot which says time-specific phrases.
To accomplish this, three classes are present. First is the RobotLabApp, which contains the main method. 
Second is the TalkingRobot class, which contains all of the code for the construction of the robot and the
generation of its time-specific phraases. Finally, the Clock class contains all of the nescessary code
for constructing a clock to be used and getting information from it.

How to start this project: Run the main method, void main(String[] args), by right clicking on 
RobotLabApp in BlueJ and selecting it from the drop down. A text window will appear with the 
time from the Clock class and the text generated by the robot.
