<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p> Our graphical percolation program is great for visualizing the
percolation process.  However in its current form it is not ideal for
running experiments.  Imagine we want to answer the following question:
<blockquote>
"What is the probability that a gas will percolate from the top row
to the bottom row in a 100x100 grid, given that each cell has a 30% chance
of being blocked?"  
</blockquote>
Your first instinct might be to start the program, create an
appropriate grid, and click run. What would you be able to conclude
from the result? Not much.  The fact that the material reached the
bottom (or didn't) tells us very little about what will happen the
next time we run the experiment.  In order to obtain a meaningful
answer, we need to run the experiment many times and average the
results.  If we run this experiment 1000 times, and the material
percolates 234 times, we can be confident that the probability of
percolation for these conditions is somewhere around 23%.  Clicking
the run button 1000 times is not an attractive option.

Running these experiments by hand will be even less attractive if we
want to systematically explore the effects of changing the probability
that cells are blocked.  Generating a figure like this: 

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

involves running 100 experiments for 21 different conditions.  That's
2100 clicks of the run button.  If we want to run 1000 experiments for
each condition we end up with 21,000 clicks.
<p>
The purpose of this project is to modify the Percolation program to
automate the process of obtaining results like those described above,
and then to use the updated program to obtain some experimental
results.

<h2><a name="start"></a>Updating the GUI</h2>

Up until now, we have placed the initial percolators by hand using the
"Manually Populate Grid" button.  For the purposes of experimentation
we want this process to be automated.  At the beginning of each
experiment the entire grid should be randomly populated with solid
cells, and each empty cell in the top row should be populated with the
appropriate type of percolator.  There is code in place to handle this. 
<p>
  
The first step is to uncomment several lines
in <code>PercolationApp</code>.  Somewhere around line 72 you should
see the following statement:
<pre>
        Class[] percTypes = {
//                              VerticalPercolator.class,
//                              GravitationalPercolator.class,
//                              AllDirectionPercolator.class
                            };
</pre>
Remove the comments and, if necessary, update the names to match the
names you used for your percolator classes. The <code>percTypes</code>
array will be used by the program to generate a pull-down menu of
percolator types.  Compile and run your updated program.  Experiment
with selecting a percolator type and clicking on the "Automatically
Populate Grid" button.  You should find that the top row is
automatically populated with the appropriate percolator type.  You
will also observe that two additional buttons have been added to the
GUI: "Run N Times" and "Run Density Experiments".  Try clicking these
buttons.  You will be prompted for the appropriate experimental
parameters, but the experiments will not run.  The next step in the
project is to write the code that executes the requested
experiments and prints the results.

<h2><a name="start"></a>Implementing Experiments</h2>

The "Run N Times" and "Run Density Experiments" buttons each result in
a call to corresponding methods in
the <code>PercolationController</code> class, <code>runNTimes</code>
and <code>runExperiments</code>.  

<h4><a name="start"></a>runNTimes</h4> 
The basic logic for the runNTimes method should be as follows:
<pre>
repeat N times:
   Randomly fill in the grid using the appropriate density.
   Fill in the top row of the grid with percolators.
   Run the percolation simulation (without involving the GUI).
   If any material percolated to the bottom, increment a counter. 

After all N runs have completed, use System.out.println to print a summary
of the results including: 
    The size of the grid.
    The density.
    The number of runs.
    The number of runs that resulted in percolation.
</pre>

There are several existing methods in
the <code>PercolationController</code> class that will be useful for
implementing <code>runNTimes</code>.  These
include <code>randomlyFillGrid</code>, <code>fillTopRow</code>, <code>invisibleRun</code>
and <code>percolatedToBottom</code>. Read each of these methods, along
with their comments, to make sure that you understand what they do and
how to use them.
<p>
Notice that we want to avoid updating the GUI while these experiments
are running.  While it might be entertaining to watch thousands of
percolation experiments, (it might make a good screensaver) the
experiments can be run <em>much</em> more quickly if the GUI is not
involved.  This is one of the motivations for maintaining a separation
between the code that handles the GUI and the code that handles the
simulation logic.
<p>
Implement and test the <code>runNTimes</code> method. 

<h4><a name="start"></a>runExperiments</h4> 

Once you have completed the <code>runNTimes</code> method,
implementing <code>runExperiments</code> should be straightforward.  It
will consist of a loop that repeatedly calls
 <code>runNTimes</code> with an appropriate series of density
 values. Implement and test the <code>runExperiments</code> method.


<h2>Improving Efficiency</h2> 

So far in this class we haven't worried very much about writing
efficient code. Computers can execute many millions of instructions
per second, so a slightly more efficient implementation of code that
moves a fish or fills a grid row are unlikely to make a noticeable
difference to the user.  The situation here is different.  The code
you wrote above allows you to easily run tens of thousands
of percolation experiments with just a few mouse clicks.  Even if each
of those experiments only takes a fraction of a second, the entire
process could take minutes or hours. For example, assume that for a
given grid size it takes .1 seconds to complete a single percolation
experiment.  If we want to complete 1000 runs at 20 different
densities, the total time will be: 1000 * 20 = 20,000 runs * .1
seconds/run = 2000 seconds = 33 minutes.

<h4><a name="start"></a>Testing SlowPercolationController</h4> 

The next step in the project is to run some experiments to get a feel
for the performance of the current version of the code.  Fill in the
following table by using a stopwatch to time the program. Each entry
in the table should contain the time, in seconds, that it took the
program to complete under the given conditions.  Use
the <code>AllDirectionPercolator</code> for these experiments.  Save
these results to be submitted along with your finished programming
project.
<p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>&nbsp</th><th>25x25 grid</th> <th>50x50 grid</th> <th>100x100 grid</th> </tr>
<tr><th>50 runs</th><td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> </tr>
<tr><th>100 runs</th><td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> </tr>
<tr><th>200 runs</th><td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> <td>&nbsp</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Is it possible to do better than this?  Take a few minutes to read
over the <code>step</code> method of
the <code>SlowPercolationController</code>.  This method works by
iterating through the entire grid, placing every object it finds into
an ArrayList, and calling <code>act</code> on each of those objects.
This is inefficient in at least two different ways.  First it is
possible that the grid is mostly empty.  In that case the code may
loop through many hundreds of grid positions just to find a small
number of objects. Second, it is likely that most of the objects being
asked to act will not do anything.  The act method will have no effect
on solid material or on percolating material that has no place to go. 

<p>
Take another look at the results of your timing experiments and write answers to the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>Does doubling the number of runs more or less double the amount
  of time taken?
<li>Does doubling with width and height of the grid more or less double the
amount of time taken?
<li>Are these the results you would have expected?  
<li>Why or why not? 
</ul>

<h4><a name="start"></a>Implementing ListPercolationController</h4> 
A more efficient approach is to explicitly keep track of the set of
items that needs to be processed.  Any individual item in the
grid needs to have its <code>act</code> method called at most once.
Once an object has percolated to the appropriate neighbors, its work is
done and it no longer needs to be considered.  
<p>
The source code provided to you includes the skeleton of
a <code>ListPercolationController</code> class that will take
advantage of this.  The basic idea is to maintain two lists of grid
objects.  One list (<code>processThisStep</code>) will represent the
set of items that needs to be processed in the current step, and the
other (<code>processNextStep</code>) will contain the list of objects
that needs to be processed in the next step.  Every time a new object
is added to the grid as a result of percolation, it is also added to
the list of items that will be processed on the next step.  
The process completes whenever there is a step that adds no items to the 
 <code>processNextStep</code> list.
<p>
Complete and test the <code>ListPercolationController</code> by
following the comments in the method stubs.  You can test the
controller by selecting it in the pull-down menu of the GUI.  Once you
are sure that your code is working correctly, re-run the timing
experiments above using the new controller.  Record the results to be
submitted with the completed project. Type answers to the following questions
for your new set of results:
<ul>
  <li>Does doubling the number of runs more or less double the amount
  of time taken?
<li>Does doubling with width and height of the grid more or less double the
amount of time taken?
<li>Are these the results you would have expected?  
<li>Why or why not? 
</ul>



<h2>Estimating Percolation Thresholds</h2>

For large grids, percolation systems like the one we are looking at
experience a threshold effect; if we gradually increase the percentage
of blocked grid squares, at some point the probability that the
material will percolate drops from 100% to 0% almost immediately.  The
goal of this exercise is to estimate where that drop-off occurs. Pick
either the gravity percolator or the all directions percolator and
estimate the value of the threshold.  The threshold will be the place
where there is a 50/50 chance that the material will percolate.  For
these experiments you should use grids of size at least 100x100, with
at least 1000 runs per density.  You will get better results with
larger grids.

<p>
You can start out by running experiments across a wide range of
densities, say from 0%-100% in 10% intervals.  Those results should
allow you to narrow your experiments down to a smaller region where
you can run experiments using smaller intervals.  Since we have
implemented our probabilities as integer values, you won't be able to
narrow down your estimate much beyond the closest percentage point.
That's OK.  Type up a paragraph describing your results and presenting
your estimate.  You should also include a copy of the raw data that
you used to reach your conclusion.  You will submit these results
along with your completed project.
<p>
If you are interested, there are many other experiments you could run
using this system: how exactly does the size of the grid change the
sharpness of the threshold?  Does the shape of the grid matter?  In
other words, would the probability of percolation be the same for a
100x100 grid as for a 20x500 grid (both have 10,000 entries)?
