</p><h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p> The Percolation program simulates a substance percolating through a
porous material, such as water or gas percolating through the
ground.&nbsp;  The simulation shows percolation through a vertical
two-dimensional slice through the material, represented by a bounded
grid.&nbsp; At the beginning of the simulation, cells within the grid
represent solid material or empty porous openings.&nbsp;
A percolating substance is added to the porous material; as the
simultion runs, the percolating substance spreads to other empty
cells.
</p>

<p>
Through a graphical user interface, the user can control how the
simulation program is run, stepping through it one step at a time
or running it for many steps until the Stop button is pressed.&nbsp;
In each step, the percolating substance seeps a little further if
it can, moving one cell at a time in one or more directions.
</p>

<p>
Through the exercises in this project, you will be creating a class to
represent solid material, and creating another class to represent a
simple vertical percolator (a substance that sinks, or percolates
down, but does not seep sideways nor percolate up).&nbsp;
In a follow-up to this lab, you will create a class that can seep
sideways or down, but still obeys gravity and does not percolate up.
</p>

<h4>Classes</h4>
<p>You will be using several classes provided for you, shown in the
  diagram below, as well as creating new classes of your own.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <center>
      <img src="initialObjectDiagram.png" alt="object diagram">
  </center>
  <ul>
      <li><code>PercolationApp</code> represents the application as a whole, and
  contains the <code>main</code> method.&nbsp;
  (You will make several small modifications to this method in the
  course of the lab, although most of your focus will be on creating
  new classes.)&nbsp;
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>An object of the <code>PercolationGUI</code> class provides a
  graphical user interface, allowing the user to create a simulated
  material, specify how porous it should be, add a percolating
  substance to it, and run the simulation.&nbsp;
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>The code that actually controls the simulation, in reaction to user actions
  through the graphical user interface, is found in the
  <code>PercolationController</code> class and its
  <code>SlowPercolationController</code> subclass.
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>The vertical slice of the porous material is represented by a
  <code>Grid</code>.&nbsp;
  The <code>Grid</code> class comes from the GridPkg library, so
  you won't see it in your project or BlueJ class diagram.&nbsp;
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>Objects in a grid must be <code>GridObject</code> objects, so the
  classes you create will be subclasses of the <code>GridObject</code>
  class.&nbsp;
  Throughout this lab you may want to have access to the
  class documentation for the <code>Grid</code>, <code>GridObject</code>,
  and <code>Location</code> classes.  This documentation can be found at
  <a
    href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/">www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/</a>.
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>For now, ignore the <code>AbstractPercolator</code> class, which you
  will use in a later mini-lab.
  <br/><br/></li>
  <li>The graphical user interface also uses objects of several other classes
  not shown in the diagram above,
  including a <code>PercolationDataFileHandler</code> that allows the
  user to read sample configurations for porous materials from files, or
  save a configuration to a file.&nbsp;
  </li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="start"></a>Creating Solid Cells</h2>

  <tr> 
      <td> <h4><i>Exercise 2 &#8212; Creating the <code>SolidCell</code>
          Class:</i></h4>
      <ol> 
          <li>
          In BlueJ, create a new class called <code>SolidCell</code>.
          This will represent a cell of solid matter in the porous
          material.  Every class that represents objects in a grid must
          inherit from the <code>GridObject</code> class; in this case,
          we will actually inherit from the <code>ColorBlock</code>
          class used by GridPlotter (which, in turn, inherits from
          <code>GridObject</code>).
          <blockquote>
<pre>
    java.lang.object
      |
      +--edu.kzoo.grid.GridObject
            |
            +--edu.kzoo.grid.ColorBlock
                  |
                  +--SolidCell</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
          <li>
          Your new <code>SolidCell</code>
          class does not need any new instance variables, since it will
          inherit all the state it needs from <code>ColorBlock</code>
          and <code>GridObject</code>.
          </li>
          <li><code>SolidCell</code> should have two different
          constructors:  one will take no parameters, and one takes one
          parameter, which is a color.  Since a <code>ColorBlock</code>
          expects to be told the color of the block, the constructor
          with no parameters will always create itself as a black block.
          </li>
          <li>
          Finally, your <code>SolidCell</code> should redefine the
          <code>act</code> method from <code>GridObject</code>.  The
          inherited method does absolutely nothing, but you will write
          a new version of the method that prints out a debugging
          message if debugging is turned on.
          </li>
          </ul>

          <br/>
          Your code should look like the following code. (Check both this
          code and your final class against the bullet points above to
          make sure that your class meets the specification.)

    {
        super(Color.BLACK);     // invoke superclass constructor
    }

        Debug.println("Solid Cell " + location() + " not acting.");
    }

<h2>Using Images</h2>
<p>You have been representing your solid cells using a solid block of
color, which was possible because you extended the
<code>ColorBlock</code> class.  Grid package applications also provide a
relatively easy way to associate a picture with a class, so that every
object of the class in a grid is represented by the same picture.
</p>

<table width="90%" align="center" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td> <h4><i>Exercise 4 &#8212; Using images to represent solid cells:</i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit the <code>PercolationApp</code> class and find the
            commented-out code that associates the
            <code>SolidCell</code> class with <code>marb1.gif</code>
            (the statement spans across two lines).  Uncomment these
            lines, then run the program creating solid cells in a grid.
            </li>
            <li>If you want, you can change the code to use any of the
            files in the <code>images</code> folder in the Percolation
            project for your solid cells.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>Often when you write a program, it is useful to keep track of some
information as you go.  You can do this by printing that information.
On the other hand, once you know you have your program working you will
not want extraneous messages coming out when you run it.  The Grid
Package <code>Debug</code> class provides a handy way to put print
statements in your code that will only print out only when you want them
to, usually during debugging.

  <tr> 
    <td> <h4><i>Exercise 5 &#8212; Debugging:</i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Without running your program, write down the program behavior
            you expect to see if you create a grid with some solid cells
            in it and then click on the Step Once button.
            This button should result in the <code>act</code> method being
            called for every object in the grid.  The <code>act</code>
            method in <code>GridObject</code> does not do anything, but
            you overrode that behavior by writing your own
            <code>act</code> method in <code>SolidCell</code>.

<h2>Vertical Percolation</h2>
<p>Now it's time to create a class to represent a substance that will
percolate through your porous material.  We will start by simulating
"vertical percolation," where the percolating substance percolates straight
down but does not seep sideways nor up.  This type of percolation might
describe the behavior of a small solid, such as grains of sand,
percolating through a material, although it would not provide a good
simulation of a liquid or gas.
</p>

<table width="90%" align="center" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td> <h4><i>Exercise 6 &#8212; Creating a skeletal vertical
                percolation class:</i></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Create a new class called <code>VerticalPercolator</code>.
          Eventually this will represent a substance that percolates
          down through your porous material, although to start with we
          will create a class that doesn't do anything yet.  That means
          that to begin with it will be very similar to the
          <code>SolidCell</code> class.
          (You may want to copy and paste some code segments from
          <code>SolidCell</code> into <code>VerticalPercolator</code> as
          you go.)
          This class, though,
          should inherit directly from the <code>GridObject</code> class
          (not from the <code>ColorBlock</code> class).
          <blockquote>
<pre>
    java.lang.object
      |
      +--edu.kzoo.grid.GridObject
            |
            +--VerticalPercolator</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
          <li>Like <code>SolidCell</code>,
          your new <code>VerticalPercolator</code>
          class does not need any new instance variables, since it will
          inherit all the state it needs from <code>GridObject</code>.
          </li>
          <li><code>VerticalPercolator</code> only needs one
          constructor, since we are not associating colors with
          percolator objects.  The single constructor should take no
          parameters, and invoke the superclass constructor, also with
          no parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
          Finally, your <code>VerticalPercolator</code> should redefine the
          <code>act</code> method from <code>GridObject</code>.  This
          will eventually be a significant method, but for now just have
          it put out a debugging message, similar to the
          <code>act</code> method in <code>SolidCell</code> but saying
          that the method is about to act:
          <pre>
     Debug.println("Percolator " + location() + " about to act...");</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Double-check what classes you need to import. Read through
          the classes imported by <code>SolidCell</code> class and
          decide if any of those are needed in
          <code>VerticalPercolator</code> and what new classes might
          need to be imported.
          </li>
          </ul>
    <br/><br/></li>
    <li>Run your program, creating (or reading in) a grid with
    solid cells in it.
    Can you create vertical percolation objects in the grid?
    (Are there any other types in the pull-down menu to the left
    of the editing grid?)
    </li>
    <li>In the <code>PercolationApp</code> class, uncomment the 
    line that would add "VerticalPercolator" to the array of
    <code>editableTypes</code>.
    <!--
    (We haven't covered arrays, but
    they act very much like ArrayLists.  One difference is that
    -->
    (Notice that one difference between arrays and ArrayLists is that
    arrays provide this short-hand method that you see for adding
    elements to the array.)
    </li>
    <li>Run your program, creating (or reading in) a grid with
    solid cells and adding vertical percolation objects to it.
    What do vertical percolation objects look like?
    </li>
    <li>In the <code>PercolationApp</code> class, uncomment the 
    two lines that will associate the
    <code>VerticalPercolation</code> class with an image.  (You
    can switch to a different image if you like.)
    </li>
    <li>Run your program again, creating (or reading in) a grid

        <ul>

          <li>
          Next we're ready to think about what the <code>act</code>
          method in the  <code>VerticalPercolator</code> class should do.
          Each cell just considers where it should percolate to; the
          global percolation effect is produced by each cell percolating
          one unit's worth in that time step.
          We can describe the logic for each cell of percolating
          substance in
          general terms:
          <blockquote><i>
                  Determine what location(s) it should percolate
                  to.<br/>
                  Percolate there.
          </i></blockquote>
          We can write this right into the <code>act</code> method as
          comments and temporary debugging messages:
          <pre>
     public void act()
     {
         Debug.println("Percolator " + location() + " about to act...");

         // Figure out where to percolate or spread to.
         Debug.println("Should figure out where to percolate to...");

         // Percolate there.
         Debug.println("Should now percolate to somewhere...");
     }</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Each of these two steps is a well-defined unit, so we will
          write a separate helper method for each.  The first method,
          <code>getPercolationLocation</code>, does not need any
          parameters and will return a <code>Location</code>.  Write this
          method, returning any arbitrary location for now
          (for example, location (0, 0)).
          <em>(How do you create (construct) a location object for a given row,
          column combination?  Look at the class documentation for
          the
          <a
              href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/edu/kzoo/grid/Location.html">Location</a>
              class to find out.)</em>
          Then replace the middle
	  debugging statement in <code>act</code> with a call to
          your new method, storing the returned location in a variable.
          Modify the final debugging statement in <code>act</code> to
          replace "somewhere" with the actual location the method will
          percolate to.
          What do you expect the behavior of this simple
          version of the program to be?
          Compile and run your program to test the modified <code>act</code>
          method and your new helper method.
	  Edit your program as necessary so that your program does
	  what you expect it to.
          </li>
          <li>Write a second method, <code>percolateTo</code>.  Does
          this method need any parameters?  Should it return anything?
          For now, leave the body of the method empty except
          to move the final debugging statement in <code>act</code> to
          it.
          What do you expect the behavior of your program to be after
          making this modification?
          Compile and test your new method.
          Edit it as necessary so that your program does
          what you expect it to.

          Update the <code>getPercolationLocation</code> method to
          return the correct location.  First determine the row and
          column of the substance's current location, and then use those
          values to return a new location that represents the location
          below the current location.  Run your program and make sure
          that your debugging messages show that you've calculated the
          right location.
          </li>
          <li>
          Update the <code>percolateTo</code> method.  The first thing
          it needs to do is to see whether the location passed to it as
          a parameter is a valid location (inside the grid, not outside)
          and is empty.  Read the class documentation for the
              <a
                  href="http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/GridPkg/GridPkgClassDocumentation/edu/kzoo/grid/Grid.html">Grid</a>
          class to find out what methods would be useful for this.
          Pay particular attention to the method details, including
          the description of the return values.  You will find that
          one of the two obvious method choices can be used to check
          for both validity and emptyness.  If the location you are
          trying to percolate to is invalid or not empty, just return
          without doing anything.  If it is OK, then percolate there by
          adding a new <code>VerticalPercolator</code> object to the
          grid in the new location.  The last thing you need to do is to
          tell the current controller about the new object you created.
          You can do this with code like the following (assuming that
          <code>dupl</code> is a variable representing the new object):
          <pre>
     PercolationController.getController().notePercolationTo(dupl);</pre>
          Thus, the skeleton
          for this method, with comments, debugging messages,
          and the statement to notify the controller of the new object,
          might look like:
          <pre>
     Debug.println("Should now percolate to location " + newLoc);

     // If newLoc is not in the grid or is not empty, do nothing.

     // If newLoc is a valid, empty location, spread to that location.
     Debug.println("Should percolate to location " + newLoc +
                   " successfully.");

     // Tell the controller about the new percolating substance object.
     PercolationController.getController().notePercolationTo(dupl);</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Before you run your program, think clearly about what you
          expect the results to be.  Then run the program and compare
          your actual results to your expected results.  Edit your
          program as necessary so that your program does what you expect
          it to.  Test your program with a variety of different grids,
          strategically 
          placing your solid cells and starting vertical percolation
          substances to fully test your program.
