Project Name: A Talking Robot

Purpose and Function: The purpose of this project was to create a talking robot which says time-specific phrases
and answer questions.

To accomplish this, four classes are present. First is the RobotLabApp, which contains the main method. 
Second is the TalkingRobot class, which contains all of the code for the construction of the robot and the
generation of its time-specific phrases. this class also contains all of the code nescessary to generate 
answers to questions. The Clock class contains all of the nescessary code for constructing a clock 
to be used for the time-specific phrases and getting information from it. Finally the SpeechToTextStub
class is a temporary class which holds code to generate a single question randomly from a list of questions.

Please note that some of the answers to questions are not randomized. For some questions, like "Where you born,"
it does not make sense to have multiple answer possibilities. 

How to start this project: Run the main method, void main(String[] args), by right clicking on 
RobotLabApp in BlueJ and selecting it from the drop down. A text window will appear with the 
time from the Clock class and the text generated by the robot.
